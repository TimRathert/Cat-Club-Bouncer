## Getting Started
You've been hired on as the bouncer at a club for cats. Keep the riff ruff out and don't let anyone in if the boss doesn't want them in. Your shift ends each day when you've checked 5 IDs or when you run out of time.  
  
If you fall 80% accuracy for two days, you're fired! The more days you work, the harder your boss will push you. How long will you be able to keep up?

You are a bouncer at a club for cats. Your job is to make sure the only cats getting in, are the ones we allow to do so. Sounds easy enough, but kittens these days are desperate for catnip and are meticulous in creating fake IDs. That's why we've hired you. Keep the riff-ruff out.

Customers will present you with their ID. Inspect each ID carefully to ensure that only the right people get in. No fakes IDs, either! If you think a customer meets the requirements, let them in. If not, turn them away.

**Psuedo**

Create cat objects with[Name, Age, Species, Height, Fur color, etc] and match them against dynamically generated criteria. If your accuracy drops below a certain number for 2 days, you're fired.


Cat Objects vs Reference Object(random values). Values fed to player who has to check the criteria. Scored after 5 rounds (the end of each work day). If match accuracy drops below a certain percentage, game over.


Cat
    Name   
    Age
    Species
    Height
    Fur color
    Eye color
    ?

Reference 
    expands cat?
    RNG cat generator LOL
    randomly generated values to check against
    dynamically add more? 1/'day'(round)?
        increment values so the criteia ranges grow progressively more narrow

    presented with ID and cat picture
        Let them in? Click appropriate button

    aftter 5 cats, work day ends and score is checked. If it is 60% or less for two days in a row, you're fired. Check dayFailed after each round.
    start next round(matching for 5 rounds)

        dynamic generation of cat or criteria content?
            if cat - choose random numers to select values from array of values
            if criteria - perhaps function to generate a filter of what not to allow

        player "does ID match cat?" (is it a fake).
        player "does ID meet criteria?" (old enough? etc)

                deny entry

    Game over - same as end of round state? 
        when daysFailed = 2, set state gameOver = true
        Do NOT start new round
        Present days completed & option to try again

        DONE 1) Make Cat Cards (start static)
        DONE 2) Make criteria (start static)
        DONE 3) test cards vs criteria [active state] - start with age & fake ID as criteria.
        DONE 4) css layout (see figma for notes)
        DONE 5) [intro state] / title screen (functionality)
        DONE 6) [start round state] - pull cats and criteria (start static) {maybe text: 'welcome to work'}
        DONE 7) 'round tracker for [end-of-round state](functionality)
        DONE 8) [end-of-round state] screen (CSS)
        DONE 9) [game over state] / screen
        10) expand criteria (static iteration or rng) - tie to [round start state]
        11) variance in cat cards - tie to [round start state]
        12) turn timer
        13) dynamic criteria generation (incremented to increase difficulty)
        14) dynamic cat generation
